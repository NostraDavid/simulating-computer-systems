\section*{Author Index}

The scan includes a detailed author index (pp.~307--308). It maps cited authors
to discussion pages across topics such as queueing analysis, simulation
validation, random variate generation, and performance modeling.

\section*{Subject Index}

The subject index (pp.~309--314) covers operational terms and model concepts,
including:
\begin{itemize}
\item confidence interval estimation (fixed-sample and batch-means),
\item verification and validation workflows,
\item queueing/facility operations in \texttt{smpl},
\item event scheduling and trace/report functions,
\item token ring, Ethernet, and multiprocessor model topics.
\end{itemize}
