\chapter{Appendix}
\label{chap:appendix-source}

The following pages in the original book provide C source listings for four
files:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{smpl.c}: the SMPL simulation subsystem (excluding random variates),
\item \texttt{rand.c}: random variate generation functions,
\item \texttt{smpl.h}: external declarations and user-level directives,
\item \texttt{stat.c}: normal and $t$-distribution quantile support.
\end{itemize}

An executable model is formed by compiling \texttt{smpl.c} and \texttt{rand.c}
(or packaging them in a library), and compiling/linking the simulation model
source that includes \texttt{smpl.h}.

\section{Listing Overview}
\label{sec:appendix-listing-overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\texttt{smpl.c}} (pp.~281--293 in the scan): initialization, element
  pool management, event scheduling, queue/list processing, facility
  operations, tracing, and report output.
\item \textbf{\texttt{rand.c}} (pp.~294--297): stream/seed handling and variate
  generators (\texttt{ranf}, \texttt{random}, \texttt{expntl}, \texttt{erlang},
  \texttt{hyperx}, \texttt{normal}).
\item \textbf{\texttt{stat.c}} (p.~298 onward): quantile routines used by analysis
  modules.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation Notes}
\label{sec:appendix-notes}

The scanned appendix is code-heavy and OCR introduces substantial formatting
noise (spacing, punctuation, and token corruption in identifiers/operators).
For this draft, code is represented as structural overview text. A later pass can
replace this with validated verbatim listings (or with cleaned source imported
from trusted machine-readable files).
